I feel that coding is an important element that everyone should try! Of course, if you want more advanced help in coding go try WhiteHatJr!! </h2>

          <h2 id="tipp"> Ok! If you've seen my thumbnails, you see that I can draw. I draw through "IbisPaintX" avaliable on mobile/ ipads. If I am correct, in Andriod devices too. It's avaliable on windows. You can also install it on your laptop/ computer with Blustacks. My biggest tip to do art or anything that you want is to practice. In the first few tries it won't be perfect but eventually you'll improve. At first, I suggest you to take a base plat for google. Eventually, you will be able to draw figures by yourself! Just imagine it in your head <3 </h2>

I still have a variety of plans for the future! Let's talk ahead. What's next for this channel? Well, I'm planning quite a few things. If you check my "About" Page on Youtube, you'll see that I've listed down various platforms. I'll be making turtorials and reviews of apps which were made with the help of the platforms. I'm thinking to start websites a little bit later. So don't drag websites into our channel just yet! Yes, I will review them but, no turtorials for the timing. Let's first finish the basics of app and game development! </h3>
